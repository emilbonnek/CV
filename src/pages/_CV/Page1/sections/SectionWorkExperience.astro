        I built a file handling feature that allows users to organize files in a
        traditional folder structure. I did the database schema, the backend
        including the Google Cloud Storage integration, and the frontend was
        done in collaboration with another developer.

        team.

        product moved to a freemium model and needed entirely new requirements
        for what users could do.

        I built several big presentational components for showing off the game

        and 3D experiences with three.js.
