        Built a file handling feature that allows users to organize files in a
        tree structure inside Openframe projects. I contributed to the spec, and
        implemented the backend as well as the frontend on my own.

        Migrated the frontends build system from Webpack to Vite, reducing build
        times by 10x and saving the company time and money in CI/CD. I also
        migrated the code from TypeScript non-strict to strict mode, which
        drastically reduced the number of bugs.

        Architected and built a limited time NFT sale event, creating a
        real-time commerce application using React. This event led to $400,000
        in sales inside a week. I was in charge of the very central real-time
        map as well as some scraping of blockchain data.
