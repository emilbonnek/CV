  <P>
    I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in TypeScript and
    experience across frontend, backend, and infrastructure. I enjoy working in
    smaller teams where I can take part in the full development process and help
    shape both the product and the codebase. I care about type safety,
    maintainability, and choosing the right tools for the job â€” and in recent
    years, I've also been exploring Rust.
