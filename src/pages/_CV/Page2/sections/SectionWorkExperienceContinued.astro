        I worked as a backend developer for Danske Bank, where I contributed to
        their front office FX trading platform. I worked with a mix of Java and
        Typescript. At the time I was also doing an Associate Cloud Engineer
        certification in Google Cloud, and worked as part of a little task force
        to deem if it was feasible to use for the bank.

        I worked as a full stack developer at Bibliotheca, where I worked on
        their nordic self service platform. I designed and implemented a
        MobilePay integration and was put in charge of its rollout into hundreds
        of danish libraries.
