    <P>
      With two friends, I co-founded Disc Tree, a webshop for disc golf
      products. I've been responsible for website development, backend
      automation, and internal applications â€” including infrastructure on Google
      Cloud. The webshop is still running today, and I'm still a co-owner. It is
      something I like to do, and I have learned a lot from it.
